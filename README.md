# MoonRageGame
Final project for programming course in my 2nd Semester at FCU IECS, 2022.

To play the game, make sure you have Java installed on your device, and simply run the command "java Game.java"
The goal is to destroy asteroids coming for Earth with Moon. This game is like a board game, When pressing on up/down/left/right button, 
Earth will move towards that direction by one chunk while Moon orbits 1/4 around, asteroids will be randomly generated from outside of the scene and make their way to Earth.
It may take a few moves at the start until asteroids are in the scene observable. If Earth collides with an asteroid, the HP of it will be decreased by 25%,
and when it reaches 0% game is over.
